Scryfall tracks the appearance of card's bounding frame programmatically with
the `frame` and `frame_effects` columns.

## Frames

The `frame` column tracks the edition of the card frame used for the re/print in
question. The overall _Magic_ frame has gone though several major revisions in
the game's lifetime.

| Frame    | Description                                                                                                    |

## Frame Effects

The `frame_effects` column tracks additional frame artwork applied over a
particular frame. For example, there are both 2003 and 2015-frame cards with the
Nyx-touched effect.
