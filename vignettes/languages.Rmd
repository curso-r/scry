Scryfall archives _Magic_ cards in 17 languages (including some unofficial
languages).

Each card indicates its language in the `lang` column using an ISO-like code.
When available, cards may also include their printed text in `printed_name`,
`printed_type_line`, and `printed_text` columns.

Please note that Oracle text is always English, per game rules. Cards printed in
non-English languages are a translation of the Oracle text at the time the card
was printed, but these texts do not receive errata.

Support for multiple languages in older sets is limited. Scryfall is expanding
this data slowly over time.

The current languages are:
