Scryfall includes a large set of keywords and expressions you can use to filter
_Magic_ cards.

## Colors and Color Identity

You can find cards that are a certain color using the `c:` or `color:` keyword,
and cards that are a certain color identity using the `id:` or `identity:`
keywords.

Both sets of keywords accepts full color names like `blue` or the abbreviated
color letters `w`, `u`, `r`, `b` and `g`.

You can use many nicknames for color sets: all guild names (e.g. `azorius`), all
shard names (e.g. `bant`), all college names (e.g., `quandrix`), all wedge names
(e.g. `abzan`), and the four-color nicknames `chaos`, `aggression`, `altruism`,
`growth`, `artifice` are supported.

Use `c` or `colorless` to match colorless cards, and `m` or `multicolor` to
match multicolor cards.

You can use comparison expressions (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, and `!=`) to check
against _ranges_ of colors.

Find cards that have a color indicator with `has:indicator`.

| Expression              | Meaning                                             |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [`c:rg`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=c%3Arg)                                   | Cards that are red and green                        |
| [`color>=uw -c:red`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=color%3E%3Duw+-c%3Ared)       | Cards that are at least white and blue, but not red |
| [`id<=esper t:instant`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=id%3C%3Desper+t%3Ainstant) | Instants you can play with an Esper commander       |
| [`id:c t:land`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=id%3Ac+t%3Aland)                   | Land cards with colorless identity                  |

## Card Types

Find cards of a certain card type with the `t:` or `type:` keywords. You can
search for any supertype, card type, or subtype.

Using only partial words is allowed.

| Expression               | Meaning                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| [`t:merfolk t:legend`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Amerfolk+t%3Alegend)     | Legendary merfolk cards            |
| [`t:goblin -t:creature`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Agoblin+-t%3Acreature) | Goblin cards that aren't creatures |

## Card Text

Use the `o:` or `oracle:` keywords to find cards that have specific phrases in
their text box.

You can put quotes `" "` around text with punctuation or spaces.

You can use `~` in your text as a placeholder for the card's name.

This keyword usually checks the current Oracle text for cards, so it uses the
most up-to-date phrasing available. For example, "dies" instead of "is put into
a graveyard".

Use the `fo:` operator to search full Oracle text only, which includes reminder
text.

You can also use `keyword:` to search for cards with a specific keyword ability.

| Expression                              | Meaning                                 |
| :-------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| [`o:draw t:creature`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Adraw+t%3Acreature)                                       | Creatures that deal with drawing cards  |
| [`o:"~ enters the battlefield tapped"`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3A%22~+enters+the+battlefield+tapped%22) | Cards that enter the battlefield tapped |

## Mana Costs

Use the `m:` or `mana:` keyword to search for cards that have certain symbols in
their mana costs.

This keyword uses the official text version of mana costs set forth in the
[Comprehensive
Rules](https://magic.wizards.com/en/rules). For example, `{G}` represents a
green mana.

Shorthand for is allowed for symbols that aren't split: `G` is the same as
`{G}`.

However, you must always wrap complex/split symbols like `{2/G}` in braces.

You can search for mana costs using comparison operators; a mana cost is greater
than another if it includes all the same symbols and more, and it's less if it
includes only a subset of symbols.

You can find cards of a specific converted mana cost with `manavalue` or `mv`,
comparing with a numeric expression (`>`, `<`, `=`, `>=`, `<=`, and `!=`). You
can also find even or odd mana costs with `manavalue:even` or `manavalue:odd`

You can filter cards that contain hybrid mana symbols with `is:hybrid` or
Phyrexian mana symbols with `is:phyrexian`

You can find permanents that provide specific levels of devotion, using either
single-color mana symbols for devotion to one color, or hybrid symbols for
devotion to two, with `devotion:` or a comparison operator.

You can also find cards that produce specific types of mana, with `produces:`

cards with certain power, `power`/`pow`, toughness, `toughness`/`tou`, total
power and toughness, `pt`/`powtou`, or starting loyalty, `loyalty`/`loy`.

[Vanguard](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t:vanguard),
[plane](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Aplane+-t%3Aplaneswalker),
[scheme](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t:scheme), and
[phenomenon](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t:phenomenon) cards are hidden by
default, as are cards from
["memorabilia"](https://scryfall.com/search?q=st:memorabilia) sets. You must
either search for their type (using the `t:` keyword) or a set that contains
them (the `e:` keyword).

Un-cards, holiday cards, and other funny cards are findable with `is:funny` or
mentioning their set.

You may also use `include:extras` to reveal absolutely every card when you
search.

| Expression               | Meaning                                            |

| [`power include:extras`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=power+include%3Aextras) | Cards with "power" in their name, including extras |

## Rarity

Use `r:` or `rarity:` to find cards by their print rarity. You can search for
`common`, `uncommon`, `rare`, `special`, `mythic`, and `bonus`. You can also use
comparison operators like `<` and `>=`.

Use `new:rarity` to find reprint cards printed at a new rarity for the first
time. You can find cards that have ever been printed in a given rarity using
`in:` (for example, `in:rare` to find cards that have ever been printed at
rare.)

| Expression                                   | Meaning                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |

| [`r>=r`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=r%3E%3Dr)                                                       | Cards at rare rarity or above (i.e., rares and mythics)       |
| [`rarity:common e:ima new:rarity`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=rarity%3Acommon+e%3Aima+new%3Ararity) | Cards printed as commons for the first time in Iconic Masters |
| [`in:rare -rarity:rare`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=in%3Arare+-rarity%3Arare)                       | Non-rare printings of cards that have been printed at rare    |

## Sets and Blocks

Use `s:`, `e:`, `set:`, or `edition:` to find cards using their _Magic_ set
code.

Use `cn:` or `number:` to find cards by collector number within a set. Combine
this with `s:` to find specific card editions. Searching by ranges with a syntax
like `cn>50` is also possible.

Use `b:` or `block:` to find cards in a _Magic_ block by providing the
three-letter code for any set in that block.

The `in:` keyword finds cards that once "passed through" the given set code. For
example `in:lea` would only match cards that once appeared in Alpha.

You can search for cards based on the type of product they appear in. This
includes some high-level categories (`st:boxset`, `st:multiplayer`,
`st:beginner`), the primary product types (`st:core` and `st:expansion`), series
of products (`st:masters`, `st:unset`, `st:portal`, `st:commander`,
`st:duel_deck`, `st:from_the_vault`, or `st:premium_deck`) or categories of
promo cards (`st:fnm`, `st:judge_gift`, `st:arena_league`, `st:player_rewards`,
`st:media_insert`, `st:tourney`, `st:gateway`, `st:wpn`, `st:instore`,
`st:convention`, `st:set_promo`, `st:duels`, `st:event`, `st:premiere_shop`, or
`st:masterpiece` — whew!)

The `in:` keyword also supports these set types, so you can search for cards
with no printings in a set type with a query like `-in:core`.

You can also search for individual cards that were sold in certain places with
`is:booster` or `is:planeswalker_deck`, or specific types of set promos with
`is:league`, `is:buyabox`, `is:giftbox`, `is:intro_pack`, `is:gameday`,
`is:prerelease`, or `is:release`, among others.

## Border, Frame, Foil & Resolution

Use the `border:` keyword to find cards with a `black`, `white`, `silver`, or
`borderless` border.

You can find cards with a specific frame edition using `frame:1993`,
`frame:1997`, `frame:2003`, `frame:2015`, and `frame:future`. You can also

`frame:colorshifted`, `frame:tombstone`, `frame:nyxtouched`.

You can find cards with full art using `is:full`.

`new:frame` will find cards printed in a specific frame for the first time.

Each card is available in non-foil, in foil, or in both. You can find prints
available in each with `is:nonfoil` and `is:foil`, or `is:foil is:nonfoil` to
find prints (like most booster cards) available in both. You can also find cards
available in etched foil and glossy finishes with `is:etched` and `is:glossy`.

You can find cards in our database with high-resolution images using `is:hires`.

## Tagger Tags

You can use `art:`, `atag:`, or `arttag:` to find things in a card's
illustration.

You can use `function:`, `otag:`, or `oracletag:` to find "Oracle" tags which
describe the function of the card.

Data for these two features comes from the [Tagger
project](https://scryfall.com/docs/tagger-tags).

## Reprints

You can find reprints with `is:reprint`, cards that were new in their set with
`not:reprint`, and cards that have only been in a single set with `is:unique`.
You can also compare the number of times a card has been printed with syntax
like `prints=1`, or the number of sets a card has been in with `sets=1`. These
can also be compared including only paper sets with `paperprints=1` and
`papersets=1`.

| Expression               | Meaning                                                                |

## Languages

You can request cards in certain languages with the `lang:`/`language:`
keywords.

You can widen your search to any language with the special `lang:any` keyword.

You can also find the first printing of a card in each language using
`new:language` and all printings of a card that's been printed in a language at
least once with `in:` (e.g. `in:ru` will find cards that have ever been printed
in Russian.)

| Expression                                                             | Meaning                                                             |

## Shortcuts and Nicknames

The search system includes a few convenience shortcuts for common card sets:

You can find some interesting land groups with `is:bikeland` (alias `cycleland`,
`bicycleland`), `is:bounceland` (alias `karoo`), `is:canopyland` (alias
`canland`), `is:checkland`, `is:dual`, `is:fastland`, `is:fetchland`,
`is:filterland`, `is:gainland`, `is:painland`, `is:scryland`, `is:shadowland`,
`is:shockland`, `is:storageland`, `is:creatureland`, `is:triland`, and
`is:tangoland` (alias `battleland`)

You can find all Masterpiece Series cards with `is:masterpiece`

| Expression          | Meaning                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- |
| [`is:dual`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Adual)                 | Cards that are dual lands |
| [`is:fetchland`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Afetchland)       | Cards that are fetchlands |
| [`is:colorshifted`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=is%3Acolorshifted) | Colorshifted cards        |

## Negating Conditions

All keywords except for `include` can be negated by prefixing them with a hyphen
(`-`). This inverts the meaning of the keyword to reject cards that matched what
you've searched for.

The `is:` keyword has a convenient inverted mode `not:` which is the same as
`-is:`. Conversely, `-not:` is the same as `is:`.

Loose name words can also be inverted with `-`.

| Expression                   | Meaning                                            |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| [`-fire c:r t:instant`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=-fire+c%3Ar+t%3Ainstant)           | Red instants without the word "fire" in their name |
| [`o:changeling -t:creature`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=o%3Achangeling+-t%3Acreature) | Changeling cards that aren't creatures             |
| [`not:reprint e:c16`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=not%3Areprint+e%3Ac16)               | Cards in Commander 2016 that aren't reprints       |

## Regular Expressions

You can use forward slashes `//` instead of quotes with the `type:`, `t:`,
`oracle:`, `o:`, `flavor:`, `ft:`, and `name:` keywords to match those parts of
a card with a regular expression.

Scryfall supports many regex features such as `.*?`, option groups `(a|b)`,
brackets `[ab]`, character classes `\\d`, `\\w`, and anchors `(?!)`, `\\b`, `^`,
and `$`.

Forward slashes inside your regex must be escaped with `\\/`.

Full documentation for this keyword is available on in `vignette("regex")`.

| Expression               | Meaning                                             |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| [`t:creature o:/^{T}:/`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Acreature+o%3A%2F%5E%7BT%7D%3A%2F)   | Creatures that tap with no other payment            |
| [`t:instant o:/\\spp/`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Ainstant+o%3A%2F%5Cspp%2F)            | Instants that provide +X/+X effects                 |
| [`name:/\\bizzet\\b/`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=name%3A%2F%5Cbizzet%5Cb%2F)               | Card names with "izzet" but not words like "mizzet" |

## Exact Names

If you prefix words or quoted phrases with `!` you will find cards with that
exact name only.

This is still case-insensitive.

| Expression                | Meaning                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| [`!fire`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21fire)                                     | The card Fire               |
| [`!"sift through sands"`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=%21%22sift+through+sands%22) | The card Sift Through Sands |

## Using "OR"

By default every search term you enter is combined. All of them must match to
find a card.

If you want to search over a set of options or choices, you can put the special
word `or`/`OR` between terms.

| Expression                     | Meaning                                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |

| [`t:land (a:titus or a:avon)`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Aland+%28a%3Atitus+or+a%3Aavon%29) | Lands illustrated by Titus Lunter or John Avon |

## Nesting Conditions

You may nest conditions inside parenthesis `( )` to group them together. This is
most useful when combined with the `OR` keyword.

Remember that terms that are **not** separated by `OR` are still combined.

| Expression                             | Meaning                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [`t:legendary (t:goblin or t:elf)`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=t%3Alegendary+%28t%3Agoblin+or+t%3Aelf%29) | Legendary goblins or elves |
| [`through (depths or sands or mists)`](https://scryfall.com/search?q=through+%28depths+or+sands+or+mists%29) | The Unspeakable combo      |

## Display Keywords

You can enter your display options for searches as keywords rather than using
`scry_cards()`'s arguments.

Select how duplicate results are eliminated with `unique:cards`, `unique:prints`
(previously `++`), or `unique:art` (also `@@`).

Change how results are shown with `display:grid`, `display:checklist`,
`display:full`, or `display:text`.

Change how results are sorted with `order:artist`, `order:cmc`, `order:power`,
`order:toughness`, `order:set`, `order:name`, `order:usd`, `order:tix`,
`order:eur`, `order:rarity`, `order:color`, `order:released`, `order:spoiled`,
`order:edhrec`, or `order:review`.

Select what printings of cards to preferentially show with `prefer:oldest`,
`prefer:newest`, `prefer:usd-low` or `prefer:usd-high` (and the equivalents for
`tix` and `eur`), or `prefer:promo`.

Change the order of the sorted data with `direction:asc` or `direction:desc`.
