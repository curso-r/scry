scry is a simple, light, and robust interface between R and
[Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)'s powerful _Magic: The Gathering_ card search
engine. It wraps the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) and makes all
endpoints available as simple functions that any R programmer can use.

## Installation

```r
# Install released version from CRAN
install.packages("scry")
```

You can install the development version of scry from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("curso-r/scry")
```

## Usage

scry makes it easy to process _Magic_ cards' data programatically. There are
many endpoints that fully support tidyverse compatible analyses. A complete list
can be found on scry's [documentation](https://curso-r.github.io/scry/).

```{r}
library(scry)

# Find red creatures with 7 power, sorted by converted mana cost
cards <- scry_cards("c:red+pow=7", order = "cmc")

# Simple pipeline that counts how many cards of each rarity have a price
cards |>
  unnest(prices) |>
  filter(!is.na(usd)) |>
  count(rarity)

# Summary of full data
glimpse(cards)
```
